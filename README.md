#Hello Sugar Labs
I'm Jade Piramide, and I'm participating in this year's Google Code In.
I am currently 13 years old and going to HJ Cambie Secondary as a Grade 8 Student.
I first heard of Google Code In from Stanford Lin, the president of my school's Computer Science Club.

I have a bit of experience in a language called "Lua," which I first started learning around 2 years ago.
I first became interested in coding because of a website named "Roblox," a website that has user created content.
